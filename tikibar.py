##Sam's Tiki Bar project in the "Pirate Bartender" Assignment for Thinkful
##Mixing delicious tiki drinks since 2017!
##Description of functionality:
## - the Bartender will ask a series of questions about your tastes (mug and drink)
## - the Bartender will mix you up a delicious beverage/s until you are done!
